# Unit1a A Brush with the law


A young man finds that `strolling` `along` the streets without an obvious purpose can lead to trouble `with the law`. One `misunderstanding` leads to another until `eventually` he must appear in `court`……

I have only once been in trouble with the law. The whole process of being `arrested` and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather `disturbing` was the `arbitrary` `circumstances` both of my `arrest` and my `subsequent` `fate` in court.

It happened in February about twelve years ago. I had left school a couple of months before that and `was` not `due to` go to university until the `following` October. I was still living at home at the time.

One morning I was in Richmond, a `suburb` of London near where I lived. I was looking for a temporary job so that I could `save up` some money to go travelling. As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was `taking my time`, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me. It must have been this obvious `aimlessness` that led to my `downfall`.

It was about half past eleven when it happened. I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully `sought` `employment` there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me. I thought he was going to ask me the time. Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me. At first I thought it was some kind of joke. But then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I `was left in no doubt`.

“But `what for`?”I asked.

“`Wandering` with `intent` to `commit` an `arrestable` `offence`,” he said.

“What offence?” I asked.

“`Theft`,” he said.

“Theft of what?” I asked.

“Milk bottles,” he said, and with a `perfectly` `straight` face too!

“Oh,” I said.

It turned out there had been a lot of `petty` thefts in the area, `particularly` that of `stealing` milk bottles from `doorsteps`.

Then I made my big mistake. At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as part of the `sixties`' “youth `counterculture`”. 

As a result, I wanted to `appear` cool and `unconcerned` with the `incident`, 

> 所以我想装出一副冷漠的、对这一事件满不在乎的样子。

so I said, “How long have you been following me?” in the most `casual` and `conversational` tone I could manage. I `thus` `appeared` to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it `confirmed` them in their belief that I was a `thoroughly` `disreputable` `character`.

A few minutes later a police car arrived.

“Get in the back,” they said. “Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.”

They got in on `either` side of me. It wasn't funny any more.

At the police station they questioned me for several hours. I continued to try to look `worldly` and familiar with the situation. When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job. “Aha,” I could see them thinking, “`unemployed`”.

Eventually, I was officially `charged` and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday. Then they let me go.

I wanted to `conduct` my own defence in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good `solicitor`. We went `along` that Monday armed with all kinds of `witnesses`, including my English teacher from school as a character witness. But he was never called on to give `evidence`. My “trial” didn't get that `far`. The `magistrate` `dismissed` the case after fifteen minutes. I was free. The poor police had never stood a chance. 

The solicitor even `succeeded` in getting costs `awarded` `against` the police.

And so I do not have a criminal record. 

But what was most shocking at the time was the things my `release` from the charge so clearly depended on. 

> 但当时最令人震惊的，是那些显然导致宣布我无罪的证据

I had the “right” `accent`, `respectable` `middle-class` parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor. Given the `obscure` `nature` of the charge, I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is `every` chance that I would have been found `guilty`. While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously `revolved` around the fact that I had a “`brilliant` `academic` `record`”.

> 当我的律师要求赔偿诉讼费时，他公然把辩护的证据建立在我“学业优异”这一事实上。

Meanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was `gloomily` complaining to my mother that another `youngster` had been turned against the police. “You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,” he said to me `reproachfully`.

What did he mean? `Presumably` that I should have looked `outraged` and said something like, “Look here, do you know who you're talking to? I am a highly successful student with a brilliant academic record. How dare you arrest me!” Then they, presumably, would have apologized, perhaps even taken off their caps, and let me on my way.
