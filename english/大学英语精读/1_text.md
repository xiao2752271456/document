# Unit1 A Some Strategies for Learning English

As we are at the start of the `course`, this seems a good moment to offer some advice on how to make the task of learning English easier.

Learning English is by no means easy. It takes great `diligence` and `prolonged` effort.

Nevertheless, while you cannot expect to gain a good command of English without `sustained` hard work, there are `various` helpful learning `strategies` you can employ to make the task easier. Here are some of them.

1\. Do not treat all new words in exactly the same way. Have you ever complained about your memory because you find it simply impossible to memorize all the new words you are learning? But, in fact, it is not your memory that is at fault. If you `cram` your head with too many new words at a time, some of them are `bound` to be `crowded` out. What you need to do is to deal with new words in different ways according to how `frequently` they occur in everyday use. While active words `demand` `constant` practice and useful words must be `committed` to memory, words that do not often occur in everyday situations require just a `nodding` `acquaintance`. You will find `concentrating on` `active` and useful words the most `effective` route to `enlarging` your `vocabulary`.

2\. `Watch out` for `idiomatic` ways of saying things. Have you ever wondered why we say, "I am interested in English", but "I am good at French"? And have you ever asked yourself why native English speakers say, "learn the news or secret", but "learn of someone's success or arrival "? These are all examples of idiomatic usage. In learning English, you must pay attention not only to the meaning of a word, but also to the way native speakers use it in their daily lives.

3\. Listen to English every day. Listening to English on a `regular` `basis` will not only improve your ear, but will also help you build your speaking skills. `In addition to` language tapes especially prepared for your course, you can also listen to English radio broadcasts, watch English TV, and see English movies. The first time you listen to a `taped` conversation or `passage` in English, you may not be able to catch a great deal. Try to get its `general` meaning first and listen to it over and over again. You will find that with each `repetition` you will get something more.

4\. `Seize` opportunities to speak. It is true that there are few situations at school where you have to communicate in English, but you can `seek out` opportunities to practice speaking the language. Talking with your classmates, for example, can be an easy and enjoyable way to get some practice. Also try to find native speakers on your `campus` and feel free to talk with them. Perhaps the easiest way to practice speaking is to `rehearse` aloud, since this can be done at any time, in any place, and without a partner. For instance, you can look at pictures or objects around you and try to describe them in detail. You can also rehearse everyday situations. After you have made a `purchase` in a shop or finished a meal in a restaurant and paid the check, pretend that all this happened in an English-speaking country and try to act it out in English.

5\. Read widely. It is important to read widely because in our learning environment, reading is the main and most reliable source of language input. When you choose reading materials, look for things that you find interesting, that you can understand without relying too much on a dictionary. A page a day is a good way to start. As you go on, you will find that you can do more pages a day and handle materials at a higher level of difficulty.

6\. Write regularly. Writing is a good way to practice what you already know. `Apart from` `compositions` `assigned` by your teacher, you may find your own reasons for writing. A pen `pal` provides good `motivation`; you will learn a lot by trying to communicate with someone who shares your interests, but comes from a different culture. Other ways to write regularly include keeping a diary, writing a short story and `summarizing` the daily news.
Language learning is a process of `accumulation`. It pays to absorb as much as you can from reading and listening and then try to put what you have learned into practice through speaking and writing.

# Unit1 B How to improve your study habits

Perhaps you are an average student with average `intelligence`. You do well enough in school, but you probably think you will never be a top student. This is not necessarily the case, however. You can receive better grades if you want to. Yes, even students of average intelligence can be top students without `additional` work. Here's how:

1\. Plan your time carefully. Make a list of your `weekly` tasks. Then make a schedule or chart of your time. Fill in `committed` time such as eating, sleeping, meetings, classes, etc. Then decide on good, regular times for studying. Be sure to set aside enough time to complete your normal reading and work `assignments`. Of course, studying shouldn't occupy all of the free time on the `schedule`. It's important to set aside time for `relaxation`, hobbies, and entertainment as well. This weekly schedule may not solve all of your problems, but it will make you more `aware of` how you spend your time. `Furthermore`, it will enable you to plan your activities so that you have `adequate` time for both work and play.

2\. Find a good place to study. Choose one place for your study area. It may be a desk or a chair at home or in the school library, but it should be comfortable, and it should not have `distractions`. When you begin to work, you should be able to concentrate on the subject.

3\. `Skim` before you read. This means `looking over` a passage quickly before you begin to read it more carefully. As you `preview` the material, you get some idea of the `content` and how it is organized. Later when you begin to read you will recognize less important material and you may `skip` some of these portions. Skimming helps double your reading speed and improves your `comprehension` as well.

4\. Make good use of your time in class. Listening to what the teacher says in class means less work later. Sit where you can see and hear well. Take notes to help you remember what the teacher says.

5\. Study regularly. `Go over` your notes as soon as you can after class. `Review` important points mentioned in class as well as points you remain confused about. Read about these points in your textbook. If you know what the teacher will discuss the next day, skim and read that material too. This will help you understand the next class. If you review your notes and textbook regularly, the material will become more meaningful and you will remember it longer. Regular review leads to improved performance on tests.

6\. Develop a good attitude about tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't worry `excessively` about a single test. Tests provide grades, but they also let you know what you need to spend more time studying, and they help make your new knowledge `permanent`.
There are other `techniques` that might help you with your studying. Only a few have been mentioned here. You will probably discover many others after you have tried these. Talk with your classmates about their study techniques. Share with them some of the techniques you have found to be helpful. Improving your study habits will improve your grades.

# Unit2 A Sailing Round the World

At sixty-five Francis Chichester `set out` to sail `single-handed` round the world. This is the story of that `adventure`.

Before he sailed round the world single-handed, Francis Chichester had already surprised his friends several times. He had tried to fly round the world but failed. That was in 1931.
The years passed. He gave up flying and began sailing. He enjoyed it greatly. Chichester was already 58 years old when he won the first solo `transatlantic` sailing race. His old dream of going round the world came back, but this time he would sail. His friends and doctors did not think he could do it, as he had `lung` cancer. But Chichester was determined to `carry out` his plan. In August, 1966, at the age of nearly sixty-five, an age when many men retire, he began the greatest voyage of his life. Soon, he was away in his new 16- metre boat, Gipsy Moth.

Chichester followed the route of the great nineteenth century `clipper` ships. But the clippers had had `plenty` of crew. Chichester did it all by himself, even after the main `steering` device had been damaged by `gales`. Chichester covered 14,100 miles before stopping in Sydney, Australia. This was more than twice the distance anyone had `previously` sailed `alone`.

He arrived in Australia on 12 December, just 107 days out from England. He received a warm welcome from the Australians and from his family who had `flown` there to meet him. On `shore`, Chichester could not walk without help. Everybody said the same thing: he had done enough; he must not go any further. But he did not listen.

After resting in Sydney for a few weeks, Chichester `set off` once more `in spite of` his friends' attempts to `dissuade` him. The second half of his voyage was `by far` the more dangerous part, during which he sailed round the `treacherous` `Cape` Horn.

On 29 January he left Australia. The next night, the blackest he had ever known, the sea became so `rough` that the boat almost `turned over`. Food, clothes, and broken glass were all mixed together. Fortunately, the damage to the boat was not too serious. Chichester `calmly` got into bed and went to sleep. When he woke up, the sea had become calm again. Still, he could not help thinking that if anything should happen, the nearest person he could contact by radio, unless there was a ship nearby, would be on an island 885 miles away.

After succeeding in sailing round Cape Horn, Chichester sent the following radio message to London: "I feel `as if` I had wakened from a nightmare. Wild horses could not drag me down to Cape Horn and that `sinister` Southern Ocean again."

Just before 9 o'clock on Sunday evening 28 May, 1967, he arrived back in England, where a quarter of a million people were waiting to welcome him. Queen Elizabeth â…¡ `knighted` him with the very `sword` that Queen Elizabeth I had used almost 400 years earlier to knight Sir Francis Drake after he had sailed round the world for the first time. The whole voyage from England and back had covered 28,500 miles. It had taken him nine months, of which the sailing time was 226 days. He had done what he wanted to `accomplish`.

Like many other `adventurers`, Chichester had experienced fear and `conquered` it. In doing so, he had `undoubtedly` learnt something about himself. `Moreover`, in the modern age when human beings depend so much on machines, he had given men `throughout` the world new `pride`.

# Unit2 B To Swim the English Channel at 58

A little `over` a year ago I began training to swim the English Channel this September. I will be 58 years old then.

My friends thought I had lost my mind; my wife didn't think I was crazy but she was `somewhat` worried. The question I was asked over and over was this: Why?

When a student reporter at `Indiana` recently asked me this question, I said, "First, let me ask you a question. What are your plans for this summer?" He `replied` that he was going to work in a supermarket. I didn't have to say more; he understood my point.

A challenge and something of an adventure are welcome whether you are 20 or 58, and preparing to swim the Channel is far better than working in a supermarket, especially when you have a choice.

But why did I decide to swim the Channel at 58? Perhaps I myself can hardly give a `satisfactory` answer.

The Channel has always been the greatest challenge to swimmers; a test of ability, `endurance`, luck, and even `bravery`. It is this challenge that attracts about 100 swimmers a year, who are willing to spend time, effort, and money trying it.

One fact that adds to my interest is that, if I succeed, I will be the oldest person ever to swim the Channel.

I don't think I'm a superman. I do think I have at least two things in my `favor`:

First, I am training hard — now swimming 7 and a half miles a day. `Prior` to that time I also kept `physically` `fit` by training `moderately` hard.

Second, I am a `resolute` man. Once I set up a goal, I won't give it up easily. And this swim has long been a goal. I have a feeling I will be `mentally` ready and won't do as one Channel swimmer did a few years ago. He trained hard for a couple of years, made the `arrangements` and even went to England weeks early to train in the Channel before his attempt. The great day came, and he started swimming toward France. After swimming only one hour, he got out of the water and climbed aboard the boat, saying that he suddenly had lost the desire to swim the Channel and it no longer `meant` anything to him.

On the other hand there was the young girl who was attempting to finish her swim when the ocean got `rough`. She was having a `tough` time with the rough and cold water, when her trainer shouted to her from the boat that he thought she should give up and get out of the water. She shouted back, "I'm doing the swimming, and I'll decide when to get out." She made it.

# Unit3 A The Present

They say that blood is `thicker` than water, that our relatives are more important to us than others. Everyone was so kind to the old lady on her birthday. Surely her daughter would make an even bigger effort to please her?

It was the old lady's birthday.

She got up early to be ready for the post. From the second floor flat she could see the postman when he came down the street, and the little boy from the ground floor brought up her letters on the rare occasions when anything came.

Today she was sure there would be something. Myra wouldn't forget her mother's birthday, even if she seldom wrote at other times. Of course Myra was busy. Her husband had been made `Mayor`, and Myra herself had got a `medal` for her work for the aged.

The old lady was proud of Myra, but Enid was the daughter she loved. Enid had never married, but had seemed `content` to live with her mother, and teach in a primary school round the corner.

One evening, however, Enid said, "I've `arranged for` Mrs. Morrison to look after you for a few days, Mother. Tomorrow I have to go into hospital — just a `minor` operation. I'll soon be home."

In the morning she went, but never came back — she died on the operating table. Myra came to the `funeral`, and in her `efficient` way arranged for Mrs. Morrison to come in and light the fire and give the old lady her breakfast.

Two years ago that was, and since then Myra had been to see her mother three times, but her husband never.

The old lady was eighty today. She had put on her best dress. Perhaps — perhaps Myra might come. After all, eighty was a special birthday, another `decade` lived or endured just as you chose to look at it.
Even if Myra did not come, she would send a present. The old lady was sure of that. Two spots of colour brightened her cheeks. She was excited — like a child. She would enjoy her day.

Yesterday Mrs. Morrison had given the flat an `extra` clean, and today she had brought a card and a `bunch` of `marigolds` when she came to do the breakfast. Mrs. Grant downstairs had made a cake, and in the afternoon she was going down there to tea. The little boy, Johnnie, had been up with a packet of `mints`, and said he wouldn't go out to play until the post had come.

I guess you'll get lots and lots of presents, he said. "I did last week when I was six."

What would she like? A pair of `slippers` perhaps. Or a new `cardigan`. A cardigan would be lovely. Blue's such a pretty colour. Jim had always liked her in blue. Or a table `lamp`. Or a book, a travel book, with pictures, or a little clock, with clear black numbers. So many lovely things.

She stood by the window, watching. The postman turned round the corner on his bicycle. Her heart beat fast. Johnnie had seen him too and ran to the gate.

Then `clatter`, clatter up the stairs. Johnnie knocked at her door.
"Granny, granny," he shouted, "I've got your post."

He gave her four envelopes. Three were unsealed cards from old friends. The fourth was sealed, in Myra's writing. The old lady felt a `pang` of disappointment.

No parcel, Johnnie?

No, granny.

Maybe the parcel was too large to come by letter post. That was it. It would come later by parcel post. She must be patient.

Almost reluctantly she tore the envelope open. `Folded` in the card was a piece of paper. Written on the card was a message under the printed Happy Birthday — Buy yourself something nice with the cheque, Myra and Harold.

The cheque `fluttered` to the floor like a bird with a broken wing. Slowly the old lady `stooped` to pick it up. Her present, her lovely present. With `trembling` fingers she `tore` it into little bits.
